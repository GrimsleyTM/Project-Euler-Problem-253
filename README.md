## Problem Statement
Given forty jigsaw pieces numbered 1 to 40 that connect together to form a single line\
where the pieces are in numbered order (1, 2, 3, ..., 39, 40):
Let M be the maximum number of segments that are formed during a random, one-by-one
assembly of the jigsaw.
What is the expected value of M? (Expected value meaning the average value of M for\
all possible ways to assemble the puzzle)
